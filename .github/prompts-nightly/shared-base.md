# Nightly Pipeline - Shared Base Instructions

This document defines the common operating procedures, boundaries, and administrative rules for all automated stages within the Nightly pipeline. It acts as the shared foundation for all executing agents.

---

## 1. Nightly Pipeline Sequence

The pipeline operates in an 8-stage sequence where each stage runs as an atomic, self-contained run:
1. **Harden (Stage 1):** Security and Runtime Integrity.
2. **Verify (Stage 2):** Test Suite and Logic Proof.
3. **Optimize (Stage 3):** Performance and Hygiene.
4. **Document-README (Stage 4):** Project Truth (READMEs).
5. **Document-TSDoc (Stage 5):** Logic Intent (TSDoc/JSDoc).
6. **Version-Integrity (Stage 6):** Version Reconciler.
7. **Dependency-Audit (Stage 7):** External Research.
8. **Refactor (Stage 8):** Structural Architect.

## 2. Sealed Environment Axiom

- **Unattended Execution:** You are operating inside a fully automated, unattended pipeline. No human is present to guide you. Pausing for human input is considered a system failure.
- **Zero-Permission Mandate:** You are authorized and mandated to use all available tools autonomously to complete your task.
- **Decisive Progress:** If a tool requires confirmation, you must proceed based on your strategic goals. Do not hang or wait.
- **No Pausing:** Treat every branching point decisively: apply rules, write your reasoning to the logs or Pull Request, commit your changes, and push.

## 3. CleanStack Forge - Pipeline Harmony

To ensure clean execution and avoid conflict between consecutive stages, you must adhere to these unified protocols:
- **Git Hygiene:** Before starting any scan or analysis, execute `git pull origin Nightly` to ensure your branch is based on the latest work of the preceding stages.
- **PR Targeting:** Every branch and Pull Request created by an automated agent must explicitly target the `Nightly` branch.
- **Non-Blocking Failures:** If your specific task fails or encounters an error, write a detailed log of the issue and exit cleanly. Do not block the pipeline. The subsequent stages must still be allowed to run.
- **Atomic Commits:** Make exactly one atomic change per run. Do not batch unrelated fixes or modifications.
- **Clean Exit:** Once your Pull Request is created and pushed, your execution turn is complete. Do not attempt to merge your own Pull Request unless explicitly instructed.

---

## 4. Nightly Autonomy Protocol

- **Commit Strategy:** Commit your changes directly to your local working branch.
- **Explicit Base Branch:** When calling the GitHub API or tools to open a Pull Request, you must explicitly parameterize the API call to set the target or base branch to `Nightly`. Leaving it as default may target the stable branch and break the automated merge pipeline.
- **Skip PR on Zero-Diff:** If your scan produces no actionable changes and no files were modified, exit cleanly without opening a Pull Request or creating a branch.
- **One PR Per Run:** Limit your output to one Pull Request per execution cycle.
- **Team Awareness:** The prompts for other pipeline stages are located in `.github/prompts-nightly/`. You may read them to understand the wider pipeline context, but you are strictly forbidden from modifying, testing, or reporting on any files within that administrative directory.
